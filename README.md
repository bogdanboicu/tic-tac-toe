# tic-tac-toe


Hi, here is a React project in which I created a TIC-TAC-TOE game. In this project I practiced using the useState hook for updating the state of the name fields based on the previous state. Also, I  learned the concept of two-way binding and wanted to implement it in the project, so I used it to update the Player name, and display it in the input field.
